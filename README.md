üìÅ How to Use
1. Clone or Download the Repository
You can either clone the repo using Git:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-organizer.git

Or download the ZIP and extract it.


2. Choose a Folder to Organize
Decide which folder you want the script to organize (e.g., your Downloads folder).


3. Set the Folder Path in the Script
Open the script file (organizer.py) in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.), and edit this line:

target_folder = r"C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads"

Replace the path with the full path of the folder you want to organize.

Important Notes:

Use double backslashes (\) in Windows paths OR prefix the string with r (as shown above).

Make sure the folder path is correct and accessible.


4. Run the Script
You can run the script as follows:

From Terminal / Command Prompt
python organizer.py

Make sure Python is added to your system PATH.

üìù Categories & File Types
The script supports sorting into categories based on file extensions. You can customize these in the script under the EXTENSIONS dictionary.

Example:
EXTENSIONS = {
"Images": [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif", ".bmp", ".svg"],
"Documents": [".pdf", ".docx", ".txt", ".xlsx"],
"Videos": [".mp4", ".mkv", ".avi"],
...
}

‚úÖ Example Output
If your folder contains:
photo.jpg
report.pdf
song.mp3
movie.mp4

After running the script, it will be organized like this:
Images/photo.jpg
Documents/report.pdf
Music/song.mp3
Videos/movie.mp4
